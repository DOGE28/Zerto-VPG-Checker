# Zerto VPG Checker

This project is designed to alert the cloud team when a percentage of a Zerto site's VPGs are down. If this happens, it is generally an indicator of bigger issues that needs more immediate attention.

# Installation

Before you begin your installation, you will need to find a machine/VM that is on the same network as the ZVMs you're trying to connect to. They are not connected to the internet, so you can't install this script anywhere.

First, you'll want to create and CD into the directory you want to use. Below is a great start:
```
mkdir Zerto-Alerts
cd Zerto-Alerts
```

Next, download and unzip the script files:
```
curl -LO https://github.com/DOGE28/Zerto-VPG-Checker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
rm main.zip # This is just for cleanup
cd Zerto-VPG-Checker-main
chmod +x install.sh # Makes the install script executable
```
If you haven't run into any errors, you can then run:
```
./install.sh
```
This script will download any neccesary dependencies, create a python virtual environment, and will create a .env file and prompt for the following environment variables:

* username = Zerto username for interacting with ZVM API
* password = Zerto password
* smtp_server = SMTP server used to send emails
* smtp_port = SMTP port, usually 587 or 25
* smtp_user = SMTP email address that sends the alert
* smtp_password = Password associated with smtp_user


 You will be asked if you want to create a `crontab` job to be run every 15 minutes. A job is created for each of the main ZVM locations, SGU, BOI, and FB. Each site will be ran in parallel. If you'd rather create these on your own, say no to the prompt.

# Running VPG Checker

If you've set up the cron jobs then this will run continuously every 15 minutes on the machine it was set up on forever. If you haven't setup the cron job, then you can run this manually via the commands below
